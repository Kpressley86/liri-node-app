# liri-node-app
LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies

COMMANDS:

concert-this
spotify-this-song
movie-this
do-what-it-says

What Each Command Does!


node liri.js do-this
node liri.js concert-this '<artist/band name here>'
node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'
node liri.js spotify-this '<song name here>'



Using the fs Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.


It should run spotify-this-song for "I Want it That Way," as follows the text in random.txt.
Edit the text in random.txt to test out the feature for movie-this and concert-this.





BONUS


In addition to logging the data to your terminal/bash window, output the data to a .txt file called log.txt.
Make sure you append each command you run to the log.txt file. 
Do not overwrite your file each time you run a command.
